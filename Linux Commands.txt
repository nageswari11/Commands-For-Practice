To connecting to the ec2 instance (server)in the aws:
=====================================================
ssh -i //Users/aveerama/Downloads/test11.pem ubuntu@3.92.207.193



Linux:
======
1) ls ==> To list the files and folders in linux

2) pwd ==> to shows the present working directory path

3) cd  ==> cd stands for change the directory. If we want to change the one or two directories forward or backward or one directory to anther directory we use cd. eg:cd bundle/

4) cd .. ==> go to one directory back

5) cd ../.. ==> go to two directories back

6) ls -ltr ==> list all the files and folders with timestamp and who is owner of the file or is it is a file or directory, or what are the permissions for the file like read and write

7) touch ==> to create a file 

8) vi or vim ==> To create a file and write inside the file
   ESC i ==> it will move to insertmode then write content into the vi or vim
   Esc:wq! ==> to save the content inside a file
   Esc:q! ==> 

9)cat ==> we have to see the content of the file

10) mkdir ==> creating a folder or directory

11) rm ==> removing the files

12) rm -r ==> remove a folder or directory

13) free  ==> to find how much memory is used in your Linux machine or laptop

14) free -g ==> it gives much better memory space in separately 

15) nproc ==> to find no.of CPUS in server of laptop

16) df -h ==> printing the disk space. how much disk space is available in the laptop.

17) top ==> insted of free, nproc,df we nave top all this displays in one command. analys the node status

18) man ==> suffix with any command it will gives the usage of the onther command
 eg: man touch

19) echo ==> to displays the any information or to printing the information provided.

20)./ filename ==> we can execute the shell script or any python script
eg: ./first-shell-script.sh or 

21)chmod ==> to give the permissions to the file  eg: chmode 777 first-shell.sh--> all permissions to all
chmode 444 xyz.sh---> read read read for all the user, group, everyone.
4--->read
2---->write 
1---->execute

22) history ==> it shows the all commands what are entered in Linux machine

===> to monitor the node health we have the cpu/ram for cpu we have nproc for listing the no.of cpus are their or not. for ram we have free command what is total memory or used memory like this.

33) custom node script: 

#!/bin/bash

################ ===>comments in scripting
#Author: Nageswari
#Date : o1/12/2022
#
#This script outputs the node health ==> metadata information
#
#Version: v1
#################

set -x
set -e
set -o

#echo "print the disk space"
df -h
#echo "print the memory space"
free -g
#echo "print the cpu"
nproc
 
ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " '{print $2}'



34) set -x ==> print script in debug mode

35) set -e ==> exit the script when their is an error.But will not error out the pipefail so thats why we have set -o pipefail comand

36) set -o pipefail ===> to enable the pipefailure insted of set -e

36)ps -ef ==>find the process in detail on virtual machine

37) ps -ef | grep "amazon" ==>print particularly specifying process related to amazon

38)grep ==> filters  the information from any output

39) | (pipe) ==> sends the ouput of the first command to the second command
40) awk ==> only print the process id or filter out the information from your out.

41) date ==> print todays date. Date is the default shell command. 
eg: date |echo "print date is" here this command will not work because of date command is stored in stdin libraries so thats why not stored in the output to the pipe(|).

42)cut
43)trim
   ps -ef | grep amazon


Q:difference between grep and awk(hok)?
A: grep gives entire statements. and awk gives a specific columns from the output.

44)ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " '{print $2}' ==>gives the specified processes columns names like processed, usernames
45)ctrl+c ==> close the process within the terminal
 
===> devops always goto logfiles and check the errors in the log file for application log files.


45) curl ==> retrives the information from the internet

46) curl -X GET api.foo.com ==> api information of specified website

47)wget ==> will store the information on the log files.or download the log files by using the urls of internet.
 EG: cat filename |grep ERROR

48) ls /etc/ ==> 100 or 200 files in etc default system.
    / ==> means find everything

49) find ==> find is used to find the location that you provided.it is powerful command we can search entire file system.

50) sudo su - ==> it will goes to the root users. sudo means substitute user do and su mens switch user 
eg: one user to another user like abhishek to suresh

51) exit +enter ==> to logout the root user

52) find / -name pam ===> to find the pam files in ls /etc/ path. it is not possible for it.


53)if loop
syntax:
if [expression]
then
	-----
	------
	------
else
	-----
fi

eg:
#!/bin/bash 
a=4
b=10

if [$a -gt $b];
then
    echo "a is greater than b"
else
    echo "b is greater than a"
fi

================
$a,$b ===>is accesing the variable
-gt ===> gretar than(>)


54)for loop==> to execute repetative tasks we use for loop
syntax: 
for i in{1..n}; 
do 
 echo $i;
done


for i in {1..100};
do
 echo $i;
done

==>first executes the conditions then go to incrementation then go for the finally go to the done statements

55)trap ==>trap is used to trapping the signals

56)kill ==> to kill a process
 eg:java program is running in your Linux machine
     kill -9 java

57) yes ==> is continuously running y in terminal

58) ctrl+c ==> for stoping that y process in terminal so here pa

==> email notification using SMTP SERVER these things are done by a trap command

59) trap "echo dont use the ctl+c" SIGINT
 EX: tap "rm -rf *^CSIGINT
